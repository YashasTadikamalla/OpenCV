- While defining path in python, use r after =, which stands for raw string.

- cv.imread: loads/reads image from specified path. Has flags to read image as colour/grayscale.
             Returns np array (2D or 3D)
- cv.imshow: show the image in a window.
- img.shape[:2] returns height and width
- cv.waitKey(x): waits for 'x' milliseconds before terminating. 
                 If 0 is passed, it waits indefinitey, before we terminate (pressing any key)
                 Returns ASCII value of key pressed
- cv.destroyAllWindows(): destroys all the windows created ad free memory
- cv.resize(): resize an image
- cv.rectangle(): uses top left and bottom right pixel coordinates. edits original
                  to fill the rectangle, use cv.FILLED or -1 for thickness attribute
- cv.circle(): to draw circle
- cv.split(): splits image into 3, b,g,r.
- cv.putText(): uses bottom left pixel coordinate. edits original
- some commands use pixel location, some use array notation of rows and columns
  origin is at top left
  height = y
  width = x
- cv.addWeighted(),cv.subtract,cv.bitwise_xor,etc can also be done on images of same size
- cv.erode(): erodes away the boundaries
- cv.threshold has different thresholding techniques. if pixel instensity is greater than threshold, it is set to maxval in case of binary threshold.
  adaptive thresh uses kernel logic to find adaptive thresholds.




- cv.VideoCapture(path/0/1): to capture video in the path/webcam/camera 2
- we read videos frame by frame
- ord('q') returns ASCII of q
- cv.VideoWriter: write video captured
- .get, .set work only for web camera
- .resize works for frames (images or videos as frames but not live stream)
